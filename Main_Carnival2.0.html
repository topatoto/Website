            <h2 >Does listening to music help you study?</h2>                
                <p>
                    Yes, it does and you should definitely listen while you work. It has been proven to reduce anxiety and stress. 
                    One study shows that listening to music lowers stress and anxiety levels comparable to that of a massage <a href="https://www.fnu.edu/benefits-studying-music/#:~:text=Perhaps%20one%20of%20the%20most,to%20help%20improve%20cognitive%20performance.&text=If%20you%20want%20to%20improve,to%20music%20that%20you%20enjoy!" target="_blank">(source)</a>.
                     According to <a href="https://www.opencolleges.edu.au/blog/2019/01/03/best-music-studying-10-amazing-playlists/#:~:text=Classical%3A%20The%20best%20music%20for,Beethoven%20and%20other%20famous%20composers." target="_blank">this website</a>, 
                     “science indicates that the best genre of music for concentration purposes is classical 
                     music.” The website then provides a list of other genres that may be useful as well such as Lofi hip hop music, space
                      ambience (futuronic sounding music; meant to create a sense of wonder within the listener), and calming piano music. </p>

                <h2>Does the food you eat impact your learning abilities?</h2><!-- this is a sub-heading-->
                    <p>Yes. According to a study conducted in 2003 shows that eating 3 meals a day were linked to a higher level of 
                        academic performance in korean adolescents. And a 2010 study found that students who ate poorly (hamburgers, 
                        hot dogs and chips) lowered their academic performance and the opposite occurred to those who ate fruits and 
                        vegetables. <a href="https://theconversation.com/brain-food-diets-impacts-on-students-are-too-big-to-ignore-33895" target="_blank">(source)</a></p>


                        <h2>What can boost memory retention abilities?</h2><!-- this is a sub-heading-->
                        <p>According to this source <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/chewing-gum-can-boost-brainpower-9231505.html" target="_blank"> (source),</a> 
                            chewing gum can actually improve memory. In the study, people scored 
                            40% more higher on memory tests than those who didn’t chew gum and those who performed a chewing action 
                            without any gum. 	</p>
